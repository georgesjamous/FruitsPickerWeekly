# 🍎🍌🍊🥝🥑🫐🥥 FruitsPicker Weekly 

A weekly exercise for fruits-picker in SwiftUI

In out next weekly we are going to go through designing components in SwiftUI.

We will follow the best practices and what is recommended by the community and build a very simple component.

Then later on, we will iterate over this component to make it more and more complex.

---

## Pre-Work / Preparation

Before the weekly, each of you should take 10 minutes out of your day and do the following pre-work.

The project is public, however you will not be able to push your branch.

**STEPS:**

1- fork the project ([Fork Link](https://github.com/georgesjamous/FruitsPickerWeekly/fork))
 
  - a Fork is simply a duplicate of this repo in your personal space

2- create a branch with your name on your personal fork (example: `georges_jamous`)

3- clone your fork 

  - duplicate the folder under `/solutions/georges_jamous` and rename it with your name
  - open the project under your name (`/solutions/georges_jamous/FruitsApp`) and edit the code under the file [`FruitsPickerView.swift`](https://github.com/georgesjamous/FruitsPickerWeekly/blob/main/solutions/georges_jamous/FruitsApp/FruitsApp/FruitsPickerView.swift)

4- and commit/push **to your private branch**.

5- come back to github, and open a PR from your Fork to this Repository

## what should the component do?

We want to create a simple fruit picker view that will allow the user to pick fruits (just one or many fruits).

You have been already given a list of fruits.
