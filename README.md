# 🍎🍌🍊🥝🥑🫐🥥 FruitsPicker Weekly

A weekly exercise for fruits-picker in SwiftUI

In out next weekly we are going to go through designing components in SwiftUI.

We will follow the best practices and what is recommended by the community and build a very simple component.

Then later on, we will iterate over this component to make it more and more complex.
